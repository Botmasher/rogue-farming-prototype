# Rogue Farming - Grim Harvest Prototype

A rough prototype sketching out the core gameplay of my Grim Harvest game idea.

## Background

I've played with this game idea in my head for about 6 months. It combines the plant-grow-harvest cycle of farming with procedurally-generated crawling roguelite elements going on behind the scenes for your "crops".

## Source Code & Assets

The prototype is under development in Unity3D version `2017.2.0` and MonoDevelop.

The images, models and code are created by myself and stored under `/Assets/`.

Getting a local demo running:
- have a compatible version of Unity
- get a local copy of this repo
- open Unity and the project
- press the "play" button to test gameplay
