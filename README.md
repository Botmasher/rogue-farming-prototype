# Rogue Farming - Grim Harvest Prototype 0

A rough prototype sketching out the core gameplay of my Grim Harvest game idea.

## Source Code & Assets

The game was built and tested in Unity3D version `2017.2.0` and coded with MonoDevelop. The images, models and code are stored under `/Assets/`. To test it out on your computer:

- make sure you have a compatible version of Unity
- get a local copy of this repo
- open Unity and the project
- press the "play" button to test gameplay
